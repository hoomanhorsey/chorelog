This the changelog for 'changelog', locally hosted on VSCODE.  There is another changelog for the vscode cloud 'chortrack' iteration.  There will be overalp

Issues

- Signup
    - App crashes after signup.
    - Reason 
        - After receiving the signup code, the app creates a table with supabase and then copies data over from the choredefault list.
        - The table is created successfully, and is named with a suffix equal to the id of the houseprofile.
        - However, because supabase is quite slow, the database isn't finished being created before the app times out.  So the app then crashes.
        - In more detail, supabase creates a table. Then app then directs the table to copy data over from an existing template table. 
            - But because the newly created table isn't ready, it crashes.
            - Eventually the table does become ready, and the info is copied over successfully. But it is too late as the app has crashed....
    - Solution
        - Create the table from a hard coded format, with all the individual chores created at the same time as the table is created.
        - Provide for a timing function, or asynchronous command, so that the app creates table, but doesn't wait around for the table to finish being created before moving to next commands
            - There may need to be some kind of check function to ensure that the table is in fact created.
        - Provide for the copying over of data to the table from the default chore list at some later date, once it's assured that the table has been created.




- Custom chores

    - SQL version used a group_concat function to consolidate all the values in a SQL column to a string of characters, which I later converted to a list of integers.
    - However, turns out Postgres does not have this function.
    - So I have simply conducted a SQL search that output a dictionary of {choreid:number} key value pairs, which i then converted into integers, and a list.
    - Which the template could now deal with to out put the custom chores.



    - Deleted chores
        - if a chore is deleted it still remains in the index, and is therefore displayed.
        - if you wish to delete a chore form being displayed on the index you'll probably need to run a check against the housecustom index before it is displayed.
        - ths is probably worth doing otherwise if a chore is deleted it will hang around indefinitely.
        - if a chore is resurrected, then it will reappear, which isn't a bad idea.
    
- Dates 
    -something weird has happened to the date format so that a preceding 0 is showing, i.e. '08' instead of '8'.
    - check the date functions as it is rendering the dates out of date order.
    - be mindful of whether the dates are date objects, or strings, or integers........

- regcodes
    - I've created a requirement for regcodes to be unique, because if you have the same regcode you'll have unrelated people sharing the same house profile
    - but if the random number generator creates a regcode that already exists then the program will break. 
        - can insert a test for this to check if it already exists.
        - or can just make the regcode generator longer to increase the unlikelihood of coming up with the same number.....

- Creation of custom house chore profile.
    - The code in regcode works to create a customised chore profile based on a houseid profile number.
    - However, for some reason the app crashes.  Potentially due to a delay.
        # One test might be to insert a delay, or try and manually close the process.
